## An Introduction

My wonderful friend Petra, half of the amazing [Adrastus Root](https://www.adrastusrood.com) author of the actually fantastic [Manly Hero](https://www.adrastusrood.com/books) (no seriously, not because they are friends, this book is stellar) posted a poetry challenege for the month of February (you can follow along here: [#februarypoetryadventure](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/februarypoetryadventure/)). I am not a poet, actually, don't tell anyone, but I don't really like poetry. That's not really fair, I have an appreciation for it, but I'm not intellectual enough to "get" most poetry. I tend to be much more literal, direct, and simple in my entertainment and emotional enjoyment. But, for whatever reason, whimsy took me, and I wrote a poem for the first prompt. And I enjoyed it!

I've kept going, writing a poem for each prompt as Petra doles them out, and I'm finding I'm looking forward to the prompt each day and seeing what weird ideas, formats, structures, and words pop out of my head. I'm actually finding that it's closer to how I think, the thoughts breathe and flow in waves and bursts. I don't know, maybe this is a new thing for me. I firmly believe that if you do: you are, so I "am" a poet, but I also think that titles and monikers need to be earned, so, for now. I write poems for a writing challege, and we'll leave "poet" for later.

I'm going to complile all of the poems here, in chronilogical order, but I may split them up in the future, but for now, here are the poems:

## The Poems
---
### Day 1 - Stone
It's taken fifteen minutes, but
the heat has drained from my legs.
I'm colder than I think I ever have been.

The sun is trying to melt through the gray,
but I think it's only half hearted.

This spot fits my ass, or my ass fits
this spot, I'm not really sure.
Causality is weird in this headspace.

Moss and lichen war for supremacy, but
the moss secretly knows it can never win.

I think I love stone, but I'm always sad when I spend time with it.

There's something there, something profound:
the human condition in a nutshell or some other bullshit.

I don't know, maybe all stones fit all asses, or
more likely, all asses fit all stones.

We are not special, but our asses make it seem
like we are...

...there's the profound statement I was looking for.

### Day 2 - Tea
You can brew tea.
You can make tea.
You can grow tea.
You can dry tea.

You can SPILL tea, and
you can spill TEA.

You can't spill COFFEE.
Yes, you can SPILL coffee,
 but,
spill COFFEE, you just can't do that.

And, that is the only way that coffee is inferior to tea.

### Day 3 - Clock
You never receive good news from a clock.

You’re late.
You have three more hours until work is over.
You’re only going to get five hours of sleep tonight.

It’s not the clock’s fault.
It didn’t choose you as it’s mortal enemy to torment for all time.
It didn’t come off the assembly line full of malice and hate;
 desiring your stress;
 desiring your frustration;
 desiring your embarrassment.

And yet, it does stress, frustrate, and embarrass.

It points out my failure to be punctual.
It points out my impatience.
It points out my immaturity by not sticking to a sleep schedule.

It’s not the clock, the clock is just a mirror: cold, reflective, factual.

It’s me.

The clock is innocent, but it’s easier to blame it than to face my own disappointment in myself.

Stupid clock.

### Day 4 - Paper Bag
Growing up, I was envious of people who got paper bags.
I know how odd that sounds, but I was.
We always got plastic. I don’t know why.
We kept hundreds of them all stuffed into the earliest acquired plastic bags.
Every once in a while, a checker would give my mom paper without asking.
My mom wouldn’t complain, but given the choice: plastic.

When I started getting groceries, I asked for paper.
I used the paper bags as recycling bags.
I was being “green”. I was “better”. I was “enviable”.

Now I’m the people who ask for paper bags.
I wonder if any of the children behind me in line are envious of me.
I don’t think so. I don’t think they notice.

I feel like I failed my younger self: bored out of my mind at the grocery store with my mom, standing on the back of the cart, waiting in line, thinking that the paper bag people were so much cooler...

  ...they didn’t have kids.

  ...they have a French Press, used that morning, but not cleaned.

  ...they listened to Kenny G. and Phil Colins.

  ...they didn’t go to church, they slept in on the weekends.

  ...they use mustard on sandwiches and unsliced sourdough from the bakery.

I still ask for paper, but I’m who I dreamed we’d be.

Turns out paper people are just as lame as plastic people.
