# What D&D Character Would You Be?

[What Kind of D&D Character Would You Be?](http://easydamus.com/character.html) is one of those online quizes that don't really mean anything, but weirdly feel like they tap into something that no one really gets about you.

I'm a huge sucker for online quizes, and I'm as often annoyed with the results as I am happy with them, but there's something about taking them that feels like someone is listening to me, so I keep coming back.

Regardless, when I saw [someone on TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@11halloween22/video/6996624799741021446) promoting this quiz, I had to take it. So, here are my results:

> I am a: __Chaotic Good Gnome Wizard/Sorcerer (3rd/2nd Level)__
>
> <u>**Ability Scores:**</u>
`Strength: ------ 14`
`Dexterity: ----- 16`
`Constitution: -- 12`
`Intelligence: -- 16`
`Wisdom: -------- 15`
`Charisma: ------ 13`
>
> <u>**Alignment:**</u>
> __Chaotic Good__ A chaotic good character acts as his conscience directs him with little regard for what others expect of him. He makes his own way, but he's kind and benevolent. He believes in goodness and right but has little use for laws and regulations. He hates it when people try to intimidate others and tell them what to do. He follows his own moral compass, which, although good, may not agree with that of society. Chaotic good is the best alignment you can be because it combines a good heart with a free spirit. However, chaotic good can be a dangerous alignment when it disrupts the order of society and punishes those who do well for themselves.
>
> <u>**Race:**</u>
> __Gnomes__ are in wide demand as alchemists, inventors, and technicians, though most prefer to remain among their own kind in simple comfort. Gnomes adore animals, gems, and jokes, especially pranks. They love to learn by personal experience, and are always trying new ways to build things. Gnomes stand 3 to 3.5 feet tall and live about 350 to 500 years.
>
> ~~<u>**Class Option 1: Wizard**</u>~~
> ~~Wizards are arcane spellcasters who depend on intensive study to create their magic. To wizards, magic is not a talent but a difficult, rewarding art. When they are prepared for battle, wizards can use their spells to devastating effect. When caught by surprise, they are vulnerable. The wizard's strength is her spells, everything else is secondary. She learns new spells as she experiments and grows in experience, and she can also learn them from other wizards. In addition, over time a wizard learns to manipulate her spells so they go farther, work better, or are improved in some other way. A wizard can call a familiar- a small, magical, animal companion that serves her. With a high Intelligence, wizards are capable of casting very high levels of spells.~~
>
> <u>**Class Option 2: Sorcerer**</u>
> Sorcerers are arcane spellcasters who manipulate magic energy with imagination and talent rather than studious discipline. They have no books, no mentors, no theories just raw power that they direct at will. Sorcerers know fewer spells than wizards do and acquire them more slowly, but they can cast individual spells more often and have no need to prepare their incantations ahead of time. Also unlike wizards, sorcerers cannot specialize in a school of magic. Since sorcerers gain their powers without undergoing the years of rigorous study that wizards go through, they have more time to learn fighting skills and are proficient with simple weapons. Charisma is very important for sorcerers; the higher their value in this ability, the higher the spell level they can cast.

I opted for *Option 2: Sorcerers*, because I've always had a greater affinity for them over wizards, as well as the underpinning idea of talent vs. learned skills. One of the features of this quiz I liked, especially from a role-playing perspective is that it gives you your scores for the other possibilities in each section, e.g.:

```
Alignment:
Lawful Good ----- XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (15)
Neutral Good ---- XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (21)
Chaotic Good ---- XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (24)
Lawful Neutral -- XXXXXXXXXXXXX (13)
True Neutral ---- XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (19)
Chaotic Neutral - XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (22)
Lawful Evil ----- XXX (3)
Neutral Evil ---- XXXXXXXXX (9)
Chaotic Evil ---- XXXXXXXXXXXX (12)

Law & Chaos:
Law ------------- XX (2)
Neutral --------- XXXXXXXX (8)
Chaos ----------- XXXXXXXXXXX (11)

Good & Evil:
Good ------------ XXXXXXXXXXXXX (13)
Neutral --------- XXXXXXXXXXX (11)
Evil ------------ X (1)

Race:
Human ----------- XXXXXXXXXXXXX (13)
Dwarf ----------- XXXX (4)
Elf ------------- XXXXXXXXXX (10)
Gnome ----------- XXXXXXXXXXXXXX (14)
Halfling -------- XXXXXXXXXXXX (12)
Half-Elf -------- XXXXXXXXXXX (11)
Half-Orc -------- (0)

Class:
Barbarian ------- XXXXXXXXXX (10)
Bard ------------ XXXXXXXXXXXX (12)
Cleric ---------- XXXXXXXX (8)
Druid ----------- XXXXXXXXXXXXXX (14)
Fighter --------- XXXXXXXX (8)
Monk ------------ XXXXXXXX (8)
Paladin --------- XXXXXXXXXX (10)
Ranger ---------- XXXXXXXXXXXX (12)
Rogue ----------- XXXXXXXXXX (10)
Sorcerer -------- XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (16)
Warlock --------- XXXXXXXX (8)
Wizard ---------- XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (16)
```
I like the option to sort of look at my second and third place options, sort of like the path not taken. I guess I'll sort of breakdown my impressions of the quiz versus my self awareness.

#### Ability Scores
`Strength: ------ 14`
`Dexterity: ----- 16`
`Constitution: -- 12`
`Intelligence: -- 16`
`Wisdom: -------- 15`
`Charisma: ------ 13`

So, I mostly agree with these scores, though, I think I'd move a couple of points out of CON and put them in CHA. I carry my stress in my gut and have a fairly temperamental stomach. I can also get migraines from time to time, so in all actuality, I should probably make constitution more like 8, as it's below average. But, I'm also fairly charismatic and the questions on the quiz that I struggled most with were those around charisma, nature vs. nurture, and identity.

As flattering as it is, I'd also take some points out of intelligence. I have no illusions of ignorance, but I was not a good student for neuro-divergent reasons, and only recently finished my undergraduate degree, eighteen years after beginning it. Since intelligence is based on *"book learning"* I think I'd manipulate those numbers as well.

With all that, this would be my version of the stats:
`Strength: ------ 14`
`Dexterity: ----- 16`
`Constitution: -- 8`
`Intelligence: -- 12`
`Wisdom: -------- 15`
`Charisma: ------ 15`

#### Alignment
This is the section that made me feel seen. *"He makes his own way, but he's kind and benevolent"* is how I see myself, regardless of how the rest of the world actually perceives me.

> He believes in goodness and right but has little use for laws and regulations. He hates it when people try to intimidate others and tell them what to do. He follows his own moral compass, which, although good, may not agree with that of society.

This could be part of the introduction to my TEDTalk for how accurate it is to me. I would have said for most of my life I was Lawful Neutral, it's only really though therapy that I've recently come to be more comfortable with my chaotic nature. That's really all I have to say about alignment.

#### Race
I'm not sure about gnomes. I don't really have any particular negative feelings about gnomes, but I'm also not sure it totally fits me either: I'm not really a technician/inventor/etc.; I have sort of become a homebody, but mostly in response to COVID and lack of resources and I'd prefer to meet new and diverse people; I like animals, but not especially more than average, I don't have any pets, and I'm not a vegetarian; I don't really wear jewelry, nor do I really like gems (I will say, I do find diamonds mesmerizing, so maybe that counts?); and I'm not really into pranks, I generally find them to be more hurtful than funny most of the time. *ALL* of the being said, *"[t]hey love to learn by personal experience, and are always trying new ways to build things"* is pretty accurate to me, so... In looking at the raw data, my second option was *human*, and as basic as they are, I think that's probably more accurate to me.

#### Class: Sorcerer
OK, so here's the thing, I never play magic users when I play RPGs. Rogues are my goto, then barbarians as my second option, but I've always wanted to play a sorcerer. Growing up, the most often used words to describe me in parent/teach conferences were: *high potential*. And while I sort of went down the burnout path, the structure of the sorcerer really resonates with me. *"[A]rcane spellcasters who manipulate magic energy with imagination and talent rather than studious discipline"* is another way of describing being a massive destruction in class, never doing homework, and generally fucking off, but then acing all of the tests to result in a rather mediocre academic career.
> They have no books, no mentors, no theories just raw power that they direct at will.

I have a very powerful *"gut instinct"* that is impressively reliable. I have massive problems with authority, stemming from a conservative Christian upbringing. And, I generally a mistrust of organizations and dogma for the same reason.

> Sorcerers know fewer spells than wizards do and acquire them more slowly, but they can cast individual spells more often and have no need to prepare their incantations ahead of time.

At first glance I disagreed with this one. Part of the reason I resonate more with the human racial option is that the humans tend to be a *Jack-of-All-Trades* sort of person, but I think that in this case, I do have a small bag of skill tricks that I use to learn/do each of my newly acquired hobbies. I also am an on the extreme end of big picture vs. detail-oriented. The example I'll often use is that I found chemistry to be rather difficult with it's massive memorizing, but physics just clicked because it was extrapolations from simple concepts. I'm also quite quick on my feet, learn quickly, and can adjust to new paradigms nimbly.

> [S]orcerers gain their powers without undergoing the years of rigorous study that wizards go through, they have more time to learn fighting skills and are proficient with simple weapons.

Again, I think this speaks to a *Jack-of-All-Trades* style. I'm not just focused on my main skill, but I'm always picking up something random, and getting quite good at it. For instance, I've been a brewer, a graphic designer, a small business owner, and a web developer, but I'm also quite an accomplished cook, I'm pretty handy and can do carpentry, electrical, flooring, concrete, etc.

> Charisma is very important for sorcerers; the higher their value in this ability, the higher the spell level they can cast.

This statement is part of why I rearranged my stats above, in this case, my ability to naturally be good at most things I attempt, but never master them, feels more like a high charisma, more than intelligence or wisdom. I'm good at most things I try, but I don't have the *stick-to-it-iveness* to follow through and do it long enough to either make a living at it or master it.

## Conclusions
Generally, I think this was a **wonderful** quiz that everyone should take, at least if you have some general awareness of how RPG stats work. I'd love to hear what you got, so if you take the quiz, let me know how it turned out and if you agree with it's analysis!
